## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zendz/aws-export-resources.git
   cd aws-export-resources
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```
   Or use environment variables, IAM roles, or AWS profiles.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main9.py
```

### With Custom Profile

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=your-profile python main9.py
```

### Command Line Options

The tool supports various configuration options through environment variables or code modification:

- `AWS_PROFILE`: AWS profile to use
- `AWS_REGION`: Specific region to scan (default: all regions)
- `OUTPUT_FILE`: Custom output filename

## Output

The tool generates an Excel file named `aws_resources_DDMMYY-HHMM_ACCOUNT-ID-PROFILE.xlsx` containing:

- **Summary Sheet**: Overview of all discovered resources
- **Service-Specific Sheets**: Detailed information for each AWS service
- **Styled Formatting**: Color-coded headers and proper formatting

## Configuration

### AWS Credentials

The tool supports multiple authentication methods:

1. **AWS CLI Profile**:
   ```bash
   aws configure --profile myprofile
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

3. **IAM Roles**: When running on EC2 instances

### Customization

You can customize the tool by modifying:

- **Services to scan**: Edit the service list in the main function
- **Regions**: Modify the region list or use specific regions
- **Output format**: Customize Excel styling and structure
- **Filters**: Add resource filtering logic

## Performance Considerations

- **Large Accounts**: May take several minutes to complete
- **Rate Limiting**: AWS API rate limits may slow down execution
- **Memory Usage**: Large accounts may require more memory
- **Network**: Requires stable internet connection

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Errors**:
   - Verify AWS credentials are configured
   - Check IAM permissions
   - Ensure profile exists

2. **Permission Denied**:
   - Review IAM policies
   - Ensure read permissions for all services

3. **Timeout Issues**:
   - Reduce concurrent threads
   - Focus on specific regions
   - Break down by service
